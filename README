brief description of files

main.cpp
    All this does is create the MainWindow object which is the GUI
 
mainwindow.cpp/.h/.ui
    This is the meat of the gui. The constructor creates the GUI and initializes all the buttons and connects
    them to the functions that they call when pressed (read Qt's "Signal and Slots" page for more info)
    Most of the business logic is included here as well. The .ui sets up the positioning of all the graphical elements
    
functions.cpp/.h 
   Nothing here yet, but it's just a place to add whatever functions, etc. that we need
   
globals.cpp/.h
   Same as functions, not actually using it but I just like having a place to put global variables

txt2speech.pro
   The GUI project is called "txt2speech", hence the name. This just specifies whats included in the project and some basic config stuff
